# Working 
This application is based on two layouts mainly. 

1. Split screen
2. Main Activity

## Splite Screen
In split screen there are 2 texts including title and tagline. Along those taglines we have used a SVG vector illustration that is being used from a file in a open source. on java file of our layout we have used a handler to start new activity after 3 second time interval.

## Main activity 
Main activity is where our business logic remains in this application. Main Activity layout includes atitle text, a value of count and two buttons with each specified for its purpose.

1. Count
2. Resent 

Java file includes intialization of Modules then assignment of ids to those modulers like textView and Button by findViewByID method. After that on click even listeners are called and then counter is incremented on Count and Reset with 0 value on Reset OnClickListener.
